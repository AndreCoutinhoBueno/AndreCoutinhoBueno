From my repository [Pricing-Fertilizer](https://andrecoutinhobueno.github.io/Pricing-Fertilizer/), here are some examples where I have applied machine learning and data science concepts:

1. Big data handling:

Techinique: read in chuncks

In the extraction of the main zipped file, the technique of reading in chunks was used.

Conclusion
The technique of reading in chunks offers an efficient solution for handling large ZIP files, significantly reducing memory usage and improving the performance and scalability of data processing. This approach allows systems with limited memory to process large volumes of data efficiently and flexibly, avoiding the issues associated with loading entire files into memory.

2. Clustering: Identifying different products traded under the same international commerce code.

3. Classification: Predicting which set of import characteristics will occur at a given time.

4. Regression: Determining the quantity, in weight or value, with the highest probability density, as well as the measure of dispersion around it.
