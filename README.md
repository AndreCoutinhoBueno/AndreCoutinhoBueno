From my repository [Pricing-Fertilizer](https://andrecoutinhobueno.github.io/Pricing-Fertilizer/), here are some examples where I have applied machine learning and data science concepts:

1. Big data handling

2. Clustering: Identifying different products traded under the same international commerce code.

3. Classification: Predicting which set of import characteristics will occur at a given time.

4. Regression: Determining the quantity, in weight or value, with the highest probability density, as well as the measure of dispersion around it.
