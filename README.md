Projects and Applications of Machine Learning in Data Science
1. Handling Big Data
Technique: Reading in Chunks

To process large zipped files, I implemented a chunk-reading technique to handle data efficiently.

A specialized script was developed to download only the latest file updates, improving overall processing speed.
Conclusion:
This chunk-reading method allows for efficient handling of large ZIP files, significantly reducing memory usage while enhancing performance and scalability. Systems with limited memory can process massive datasets flexibly and avoid memory overload by not loading entire files at once.

2. Normalization
Technique: Clustering

Through clustering, I identified different products traded under the same international commerce code to better understand their behaviors and improve prediction accuracy.

Example:
For fertilizers imports, initial data showed abnormal distributions with uneven weights. After applying clustering, three distinct groups emerged:

Very low imports and outliers: Data points that were filtered out as irrelevant.
High-purity MAP (smaller imports): A premium product used for foliar spraying.
Standard MAP (common imports): Widely used as a soil fertilizer.
This approach enabled a clearer segmentation of product data, improving prediction models and insights.

3. Classification
Objective: Predicting the set of import characteristics likely to occur within a given timeframe.

4. Regression
Objective: Estimating quantities (weight or value) with the highest probability density while measuring dispersion around the predicted value.

This structured approach demonstrates practical applications of machine learning techniques like clustering, classification, and regression to solve real-world challenges in the fertilizer market.
